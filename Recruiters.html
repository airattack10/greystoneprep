<p>On behalf of the Greystone Staff and students, we welcome you to the Greystone website. We congratulate you for locating our site and for your interest in our program. It is our intent to help you as well as those candidates you represent because at the end of the day, we both seek the same goal – to send the very best young men and women to the academies. If we can be of service to you or to those you are working with, we stand ready to help. The academy candidates at Greystone have chosen the path that they feel is best for him or her to earn their academy appointment. Regardless, if they are sponsored or a free-agent, Greystone stands ready to assist all who are in need of our unique services. Greystone is focused on significantly improving the credentials for our candidates by providing them with a full-year of university-level challenge and academy preparation. Upon completion of their time at Greystone, our students have proven that this experience empowers them to excel when they arrive at the academies – as scholars, athletes and leaders. </p>

Over the years, Greystone has evolved from a program focused solely on empowering candidates to earn their academy appointment to a continuously adapting program to provide candidates with the skills and experience necessary to excel at the academies through graduation...and commissioning! As a Not-For-Profit 501(c)(3), Greystone accepts all candidates regardless of their gender or diversity status. So long as an academy candidate meets the University of the Ozarks admission criteria, they are welcome into the program.</p>

<p>As an academy representative, you are welcome to contact Greystone at any time. Should you be in the area, you are welcome to visit Greystone – we are always here! You are encouraged to participate in any of the scheduled Greystone events – especially the Greystone Honor Code and Standards of Conduct Presentation during the Fall Semester. Additionally, should you have a candidate interested in Greystone, they too are welcome to visit or participate in any of the Greystone events or activities. Should you have a candidate in need of a Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA), Greystone runs a CFA every month during the first semester and on an “as needed” basis during the second semester. Candidates required to perform the Physical Readiness Test (PRT) or the Physical Fitness Examination (PFE) can also schedule these assessments through the Greystone office.</p>

The Murder Board affords the candidate with a “dress rehearsal” for their actual congressional interview. The Board is comprised of retired officers, community leaders, and University Faculty/Staff. Students are evaluated based upon their answers to questions, appearance, demeanor, hand use, posture, eye contact, and communication skills. Once the candidate is presented to the Board, the process is completed within 30 minutes. The candidate is asked to leave the room while the Board discusses the candidate’s performance. At the end of their discussion, the candidate is brought back into the room and receives a debrief from every board member. The effort put forth by the Board has contributed significantly to the 99% success rate of our candidates earning at least one nomination. Should you have a candidate that could benefit from such an experience before their nomination interview, please contact the Greystone office to make arrangements for the Murder Board interview.</p>

<p>During the summer, Greystone hosts a series of GoToWebinars designed to help the candidate prepare for the nomination and academy application process. Students learn about time management, physical fitness, and how to write an effective application for a nomination and academy application. The program is intended for students who will be entering Greystone as part of the incoming class. However, if you feel you have a candidate in need of our assistance, please have your candidate contact the Greystone office to obtain a schedule for the GoToWebinars.</p>

<p>At the end of July, Greystone hosts an Ice Breaker and Orientation for the incoming Greystone Class. At this point, we begin a 3-week Summer Session designed to get a head start on the Nomination and Academy Applications, begin morning PT, evening Study Halls, and write the Class Honor Code and Standards of Conduct. Students not enrolled in the year-long Greystone program are welcomed to join the team for the 3-week session to get a running start on the admin challenges that await them.</p>

These lectures are open to the public, and all academy candidates are invited to attend and participate in these opportunities to enhance their understanding of the military and the profession of arms.</p>
