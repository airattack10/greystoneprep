<p>On behalf of the Greystone Staff and students, we welcome you to the Greystone website.&nbsp; We congratulate you for having found our site and for your interest in our program.&nbsp; It is our intent to help you as well as those candidates you represent because at the end of the day, we both seek the same goal &ndash; to send the very best young men and women to the academies.&nbsp; If we can be of service to you or to those you are working with, we stand ready to help.&nbsp; Because Greystone is not for everyone, whether or not a student elects to attend Greystone is irrelevant.&nbsp; What is relevant is that the candidates choose the path that is best for him or her to earn their academy appointment or their selection into a program leading to a degree and commission.&nbsp; Greystone stands for all who desire to maximize their year of prep so they can go on to an academy for the purpose of maximizing their 4-year academy opportunity.&nbsp; So long as they accomplish that mission, they will be fully capable of serving as the finest leader possible.&nbsp; Those they will someday lead deserve nothing but the best from their leaders and Greystone stands by to assist in that process.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/132687_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: left;" />Since our start in 2004, Greystone has worked closely with all five of the Federal Service Academies to ensure what we are doing with our candidates meets their expectations.&nbsp; Over the years, Greystone has evolved from a program completely focused on empowering candidates to earn their academy appointment to where we are now &ndash; enhancing the program to provide candidates with the skills and experience necessary to excel through the academies to graduation&hellip;and commissioning!</p>

<p>Greystone is approved by the Naval Academy Foundation, the West Point Preparatory Scholars Program and the Air Force Academy Falcon Foundation for their sponsored candidates.&nbsp; Greystone also accepts candidates who are not sponsored &ndash; free agents.&nbsp; As a Not-For-Profit 501(c)(3), Greystone also accepts all candidates regardless of their gender or diversity status.&nbsp; So long as an academy candidate meets the Schreiner University admission criteria and is willing to provide Greystone with a 110% effort 100% of the time, they are welcome into the program.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/133101_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: right;" />As an academy representative, you are welcome to contact Greystone at any time.&nbsp; Should you be in the area, you are welcome to visit Greystone &ndash; we are always here!&nbsp; You are encouraged to participate in any of the scheduled Greystone events &ndash; especially the Greystone Honor Code and Standards of Conduct Presentation during the Fall Semester.&nbsp; Additionally, should you have a candidate interested in Greystone, they too are welcome to visit or participate in any of the Greystone events or activities.<br />
Should you have a candidate in need of a Candidate Fitness Assessment (CFA), Greystone runs a CFA every month during the first semester and on an &ldquo;as needed&rdquo; basis during the second semester.&nbsp; Candidates required to perform the Physical Readiness Test (PRT) or the Physical Fitness Examination (PFE) can also schedule these assessments through the Greystone office.</p>

The candidate is presented to the Board and the process is completed within 30 minutes.&nbsp; The candidate is asked to leave the room while the Board discusses the candidate&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp; At the end of their discussion, the candidate is brought back into the room where he/she receives a debrief from every member of the Board.&nbsp; The efforts put forth by the Board have contributed significantly to the 99% success rate of our candidates earning at least one nomination.&nbsp; Should you have a candidate that could benefit from such an experience prior to their nomination interview, please contact the Greystone office to make arrangements for the Murder Board interview.</p>

<p>During the summer, Greystone hosts a series of GoToWebinars designed to help the candidate prepare for the nomination and academy application process.&nbsp; Students learn about time management, physical fitness and how to write an effective application for a nomination and academy application.&nbsp; The program is intended for students who will be entering Greystone as part of the incoming class; however, if you feel you have a candidate in need of our assistance, please have your candidate contact the Greystone office to obtain a schedule for the GoToWebinars.</p>
