<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/134159_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: left;" />As aspiring leaders, Greystone students are willing to live by an Honor Code that they write and then sign.&nbsp; They are willing to live by a Standard of Conduct that they also write&nbsp;and then sign - in a&nbsp;public forum.&nbsp; They are willing to work very hard from 0530 every morning until late into the night to make their mind, body and spirit&nbsp;stronger.&nbsp; They are willing to set the example for those seeking a mentor or friend and to lend a helping hand to those in need who are much less fortunate.&nbsp; They become men and women of action, no longer willing to look the other way.&nbsp; They become teammates&nbsp;with others, who like themselves, seek to become the best of the best.&nbsp; For those&nbsp;on the team, they are more than teammates and classmates, they are brothers or sisters with whom they treat with respect and dignity. They learn the meaning of truth and trust and honor - all essential elements as&nbsp;they grow into men and women of character and integrity.&nbsp; The question is why?&nbsp; Why endure so much when there are such easier ways to get by.&nbsp; Is it excellence or is it tenacity?&nbsp; The answer is derived from&nbsp;their own definition of leadership &ndash; and how they define it as their end state.</p>

<p>Greystone students learn about servant leadership.&nbsp; For many &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; this concept is foreign - nothing more than words, however, for the true leader &ndash; one who must take those he or she will lead into harm&rsquo;s way, servant leadership is more than words &ndash; it is a promise and a way of life. A promise to put the needs of those they lead (them) and their well-being before their own.&nbsp; It is about taking care of those they lead because as their leader, they must&nbsp;trust with their lives in you.&nbsp; It is for<strong> them </strong>that you are willing to push yourself toward excellence in all that you do &ndash; every minute of every day.&nbsp; It is for <strong>them</strong> that you choose the hard road &ndash; the road of truth, trust, honor and character.&nbsp; It is for<strong> them </strong>that you are willing to fight&nbsp;&ndash; because they will fight for you!&nbsp; It is for <strong>them</strong> that you become the very best leader you can possibly be.</p>

<p>For this reason &ndash;<strong> them </strong>&ndash; Greystone students are willing to put it all on the line and perform to their highest potential &ndash; as a scholar, athlete and leader.&nbsp; They know that somewhere out there is that group of men and women who are, at this very moment, enduring hardship at the pointed end of the spear.&nbsp; And while they are&nbsp;in harm&rsquo;s way, Greystone students know that they have an obligation to <strong>them</strong> to do what is right and what is best.&nbsp;Every moment that is spent&nbsp;in the&nbsp;pursuit of their commission as a leader should be a moment dedicated to <strong>them</strong>.&nbsp; From the moment our students arrive at Greystone their life changes from the pursuit of self-serving interests to&nbsp;the pursuit of excellence&nbsp;&ndash; as a scholar, athlete and leader.&nbsp; Their dedication to <strong>them</strong> will serve to drive that engine needed to empower each student with self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem so they grow toward their ultimate goal of becoming the best <u><strong>for</strong></u> the best!&nbsp; This is the Greystone mindset and it is the attitude that maintains the focus and dedication for all of the right reasons.&nbsp; There is clarity of purpose and&nbsp;every moment that is invested in <strong>them </strong>moves the academy candidate one step closer to that appointment and the leader one step closer to that commission.&nbsp; The stakes are high and there are no guarantees, but the goal is worthy of a your total&nbsp;commitment and it is for this reason that so many Greystone students succeed where so many others fall short.</p>

<p>Somewhere out there are those men and women who are waiting for their Greystone students and soon-to-be academy graduates and commissioned officers to assume the awesome responsibility of command&nbsp;&ndash; and it is for <strong>them</strong> that each Greystone student, academy cadet and midshipman, and commissioned officer must do their very&nbsp;best at all times.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Always Ready&hellip;For &quot;Them.&quot;<br />
