<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<hr />
<h4>Why has Schreiner University brought the Greystone Program to its campus?&nbsp;</h4>

<p>In keeping with its high standard established for the Schreiner student body, the addition of highly motivated and highly qualified students aspiring to qualify for an appointment to a service academy is a perfect match. It is interesting to note that Schreiner was originally created in 1923 as &quot;high grade instruction and military training for boys and young men as preparation for college and university work.&quot; Greystone students excel in the academic environment created by Schreiner - small class size, courses taught by a professor, high level of academic expectation and access to additional help beyond the classroom. Schreiner and Greystone believe that a liberal arts foundation provides a strong grounding for those considering a military profession. By providing a year of intense academic experience, Greystone students are better prepared to undertake the similar scholastic rigors they will encounter once they arrive at the academy. This endeavor with Greystone is one that is well within the boundaries of Schreiner&#39;s mission.</p>

<h4>How does Greystone fit into Schreiner University?</h4>

<p>Schreiner University is an accredited four-year university with an established history and reputation for academic excellence. Since Greystone students are not required to wear a uniform, they assimilate directly into the campus community by attending classes with Schreiner students and are encouraged to participate in all campus organizations and activities. Greystone students are full-time Schreiner students and have access to all Schreiner facilities.</p>

<h4>Who should apply to Greystone?</h4>

<p>The structure, organization and oversight Greystone provides is designed for students who applied to an academy but were not accepted. Greystone also accepts students who have not applied but are willing to put forth the significant effort required to compete for an academy nomination and appointment. Students accepted into the Greystone program must first meet Schreiner&#39;s admission requirements and be accepted to Schreiner.</p>

<h4>What classes will Greystone students take?</h4>

<p>To fulfill the academic requirements established by the academies, Greystone students enroll in up to 19 credit hours per semester for a total of 38 credit hours for the academic year. Depending on the students&#39; previous studies, the Greystone core curriculum may include Calculus I and II, Chemistry I and II with lab, English composition I and II, American History I and II, International Political Science I and II, Economics I and II, Physics I and II and Freshman Seminar. Outside of academics, Greystone students are also required to participate in daily Physical Training program, weekly Character Development and Leadership Training, Toastmasters meetings, after class intramural sports and participate in approximately 200 hours of community service. They also participate in a mandatory four-hour study hall six nights per week (Sunday through Friday). The Greystone program focuses on the three characteristics that the academies seek in outstanding candidates: academics, leadership and physical excellence. Similar to the academies, Greystone rooms are inspected daily, students live according to an Honor Code and Standards of Conduct that they write, and take every SAT/ACT examination offered from September through January. The academic objective is to keep each student challenged and fully engaged while providing them with the means to excel as a Schreiner student and eventually as a cadet or midshipman at the academies. The Greystone program meets and exceeds the academy recommendation for post high school candidate who wish to reapply for their appointment.</p>

<h4>Will Greystone students stand out from the other Schreiner students?</h4>

<p>Greystone students enjoy the full spectrum of academic and athletic participation as well as social interaction. Greystone students do not wear uniforms yet they are required to maintain the dress code and grooming standard while on campus. Greystone students share academic classes with non-Greystone students but attend Greystone-specific Character Development, Leadership Training and Toastmasters meetings, as well as a more rigorous physical training program on weekday mornings. All Greystone students, however, live on campus in either the LA Schreiner or Flato residence halls.</p>

<h4>Is it very expensive to attend Greystone at Schreiner University?</h4>

<p>For academy-bound candidates, the cost of preparatory education is an investment in their future academy experience. Selecting the appropriate academy prep program results in an advantage in preparedness should the candidate earn his or her academy appointment. Schreiner University has made the one-year program more affordable by providing each student with a Schreiner Merit scholarship which reduces the cost of room, board, tuition, and fees. Greystone students also pay for supplies, transportation, and other personal or miscellaneous fees and expenses. Students sponsored by the Naval Academy Foundation, The West Point Association of Graduates, or the Air Force Academy Falcon Foundation receive an additional scholarship to further reduce their Schreiner costs. Even though costs are reduced for Greystone students, they enjoy complete access to all campus facilities and activities.</p>

<h4>Is there an affiliation with an academy foundation?</h4>

<p>Currently the Naval Academy Foundation, the West Point Association of Graduates (AOG), and the Air Force Academy Falcon Foundation send sponsored students to Greystone. Students who meet the high standard of excellence established by either the Naval Academy, Military Academy, or Air Force Academy are automatically considered for selection as a sponsored student. Not only does a Foundation or AOG sponsored student receive an additional Schreiner scholarship as mentioned above, but the Foundation or AOG also assists with part of the student&#39;s remaining tuition costs.</p>

<h4>What happens if a Greystone student is unsuccessful after the first year at Schreiner?</h4>

<p>The year invested in Greystone is valuable in terms of educational options. While at Schreiner University, Greystone students earn up to 38&nbsp;college credits, which is unique to an academy prep program. Any Greystone student who does not receive an appointment has several academic options: continue at Greystone for another year in pursuit of their academy appointment; continue college education as a Schreiner sophomore; or take their earned credit hours and transfer to another college or university as a sophomore. The bottom line is that time invested in Greystone/Schreiner University is not wasted - each student completes their freshman year and earns up to 38 college credits that are fully transferable toward their degree.</p>

<h4>What are the benefits for a candidate who attends Greystone at Schreiner University?</h4>

<p>A Greystone student who earns their academy appointment can elect to use their Schreiner experience to give them an advantage in one of two ways: they can choose to validate academy courses which will free their first year matrix and allow it to be populated with sophomore year courses. The advantage of this option is to afford&nbsp;the student with the opportunity to work on special programs during their senior year (Rhodes Scholars, Owens Scholars, Trident Scholars, or a civilian master&#39;s degree program). For those who desire to pursue a competitive career field like aviation, special forces, etc., high class standing is essential to the success of this venture. The majority of the class standing is determined by GPA and therefore Greystone students utilize their Schreiner academic experience to retake those same courses at the academy for a better grade. The better grade equates to a higher GPA which translates to a higher class standing making those competitive career fields obtainable.</p>

<h4>Can earned Schreiner credits be transferred to an academy?</h4>

<p>Depending on the academy, some Schreiner credits are transferable. If credits are not transferable, the Schreiner courses Greystone students enroll in as part of the core curriculum are in-sync with the academy first year courses and therefore provide students a significant academic advantage in terms of college-level experience which promotes improved academic success. If a student is not allowed to receive credit for their Schreiner courses, they will be allowed to validate or &quot;test out&quot; of courses upon arrival at the academy.</p>

<h4>Is a Greystone student guaranteed an academy appointment after the year at Schreiner?</h4>

<p>No academy prep school can guarantee a student an appointment - not even the prep schools supported by the academies. All students must compete for their appointments. The Greystone program, however, maximizes a student&#39;s competitiveness and options.</p>

<h4>How do I apply to the Greystone Program?</h4>

<p>Students must complete a Schreiner/Greystone application. <a href="https://jrm.targetx.com/orgs/00Dj00000028oS8EAI/login">This application can be found online by following this link</a>. The completed application and all required documents must be forwarded to Schreiner University for an admission determination. Questions about admission and/or financial aid should be addressed to:</p>
