<p>For those candidates seeking an appointment to the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy or the Merchant Marine Academy, they are required to obtain a nomination in order to complete their academy application requirements and be considered for an appointment.&nbsp; The Coast Guard Academy does not require a nomination as part of their application process.</p>

<p>Unlike any other academy preparatory school in the nation, Greystone requires candidates to apply to all nomination sources for which they are eligible.&nbsp; All candidates will apply to&nbsp;their congressional representative from their home district,&nbsp;both of their home state senators and&nbsp;the Vice President - a minimum of FOUR nominations!&nbsp; Additionally, for students who are eligible, they will also apply for the Presidential nomination (one application is sent to each&nbsp;academy to which&nbsp;they are&nbsp;applying).&nbsp;</p>

<p><img height="247" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/132540_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px; float: left;" width="188" />What&nbsp;separates Greystone from all other programs is the amount of detailed oversight that the Greystone Staff provides for each nomination application.&nbsp;To ensure completion of this task prior to the start of the academic year, Greystone begins working with each candidate during the summer training process which begins in June.&nbsp; During this period, students participate in&nbsp;a series of online GoToWebinars in the comfort of their own home. Each session is&nbsp;designed to address each part of the&nbsp;entire nomination package requested by each separate nominating source and then provide opportunities to work with the candidates on their individual applications.&nbsp; Where most&nbsp;recent high school graduates are occupied with &quot;other&quot; things (distractions), Greystone students are busy completing the administrative requirements necessary to apply for all nominations.&nbsp;Completing these tasks over the summer enables the Greystone students to focus on their academics once the&nbsp;Schreiner academic year begins. This is key to enhancing a student&#39;s academic performance so that they can be as competitive as possible!</p>

<p>Since the start of the Greystone program in 2004, 99% of all Greystone students have earned at least one academy nomination&nbsp;and most Greystoners have earned multiple nominations.&nbsp; For every nomination earned, the qualified&nbsp;candidate is afforded one&nbsp;opportunity for his or her academy application package to be presented&nbsp;to the academy admissions board.&nbsp; Without a nomination, a candidate cannot be presented to the admissions board, which makes the nomination a critical key in the appointment process and the reason why Greystone dedicates so much time and effort&nbsp;into each candidate&#39;s&nbsp;completed nomination package. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While finalizing their nomination packages, each Greystone student receives a list of questions that have been compiled&nbsp;from many years of student nomination interviews.&nbsp; These questions, along with a series of documents that each student writes over the summer helps the candidate to&nbsp;realize exactly what attending the academy means, what their service commitment means and what their future as a military officer means to them.&nbsp; Through this process, the student develops a strong sense of self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem, which is essential to each Greystone&nbsp;candidate who must present him/herself as serious contender for&nbsp;that particular nomination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to their nomination interview, all Greystone students will be presented&nbsp;before a formal board which is comprised of senior military officers, University Faculty and Staff as well as&nbsp;community leaders. The board members will ask the candidate&nbsp;questions and then evaluate their responses.&nbsp; Each member of the board is asked to&nbsp;write an evaluation which will be briefed to the candidate by the board.&nbsp; The performance evaluations allow each member of the board to grade the candidate on&nbsp;their appearance, poise and composure&nbsp;to the way in which they answered each question.&nbsp; The intent is to provide&nbsp;candidates with a means to identify areas that need immediate attention and also to reinforce those areas that are exceptional.&nbsp; The Murder Board is a professional preparation&nbsp;for the actual nomination interview whether that is in person, over the phone or a video teleconference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clearly, given the success rate of our students earning their nominations, Greystone students are truly prepared&nbsp;for their nomination interviews.&nbsp; How a candidate presents him/herself to their nomination board means all the difference when it is time for the Congressman or Senator&#39;s board to determine who receives the nomination and who does not.&nbsp; At Greystone, we are very serious about the entire process and therefore, our students are very knowledgeable and prepared to impress not only the nomination boards, but all who they meet and interact with during their year at Greystone.&nbsp;Greystone students know that as academy candidates, more is expected of them professionally and therefore, it is imperative that our candidates begin and then sustain a process of development and maturity that will signify to all they meet and interact with that they are academy material and they are worthy of full consideration for not only a nomination, but ultimately, their appointment. Greystone students just don&#39;t dream about going to an academy - they live it every day that they are part of the Greystone program.&nbsp;Much is expected of them, but much is earned for those serious about competing for their nomination and appointment.</p>

<p>If you perceive that a prep school is not doing all it can to assist you across the broad spectrum of requirements you need to earn your nomination and academy appointment, then you should seriously consider Greystone.</p>
