<hr />
<p>As a sponsored student with the USAFA Falcon Foundation, your curriculum at Greystone and Schreiner University is a reflection of what you will see during your doolie&nbsp;year. You will be enrolled in general freshman courses that are recommended by the Academy.&nbsp;Our Academic Director, Captain Tom Vortmann will register you for your first semester and will guide you through the registration process in the second semester. You can see the classes that 99% of our foundation-sponsored students take during their year at Greystone, below.</p>

<ol>
	<li>General Chemistry I &amp; II (with lab component)</li>
	<li>College Physics or University Physics I &amp; II (with lab component)</li>
	<li>English I &amp; II</li>
	<li>College Algebra (Can be taken over the summer)</li>
	<li>Second Math Course&nbsp;(Pre-Calculus, Calc I, Calc II, Linear Algebra, etc.)</li>
	<li>IDST (Freshman Studies coupled with Leadership Training and Character Development)</li>
	<li>Second Semester Elective&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks to our relationship with Schreiner University, class schedules can be tailored to meet the specific needs of our students. Each Greystone student is evaluated across the different subjects&nbsp;to determine the class they should be enrolled in. For example, if a student was enrolled in one year of AP Calculus in high school and scored well on the AP Exam, they should&nbsp;take Calculus II as their first semester math course and then move on to Calculus III or Linear Algebra in the spring semester. To do otherwise, to &#39;repeat&#39; a course, tells Academy Admissions that you&#39;re unwilling to challenge yourself, that you&#39;re taking the easy road to inflate your GPA.&nbsp;With this flexibility in class schedules, we can ensure that our students are challenged, but not overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p>
