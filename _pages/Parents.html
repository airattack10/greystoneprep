Conversely, the Greystone Staff will ensure that we communicate with the parents when we notice changes in their son or daughter.&nbsp; Effective two-way communication between the parents and Greystone will ensure that your son or daughter is able to maximize what this program is designed to deliver &ndash; sustained superior performance in the classroom, on the athletic field and as leaders.&nbsp; Parents can rest assured that as a Staff, we take our responsibilities seriously and therefore you have access to the entire Greystone Staff at all times &ndash; period.&nbsp; We are here for you too!</p>

<p>One of the most challenging and exasperating moments of your life had to be the experience of the nomination and academy application process.&nbsp; Parents have informed Greystone of their frustration as they attempted to help their sons or daughters fill out their applications properly, obtain all of those letters of recommendation, deal with DODMERB, communicate with the congressman and senator&nbsp;offices, talk to the academies and their recruiters &ndash; it was mind numbing and exhausting!&nbsp; Unfortunately, that is the way the game is played, but there is a silver lining &ndash; Greystone will take on much of this burden.&nbsp; The Staff understands how the entire process works and it is our responsibility to ensure that each candidate submits a completed package for each nomination and each academy &ndash; on time!&nbsp; We work with DODMERB to ensure that all steps are taken should there be a need for a waiver.&nbsp; We work closely with the academies and their recruiters to answer all questions and to monitor their application status.&nbsp; We go the extra mile to oversee the entire process to ensure that every part of the process is completed and that it is &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;.&nbsp; Greystone assumes the duties as your son&rsquo;s or daughter&rsquo;s advocate and we help them to get the job done &ndash; all of this while they are maximizing their academics, physical conditioning, involved in community service and do all of the many&nbsp;other parts that go into the Greystone experience.&nbsp; In the end, your son or daughter will earn everything that they are entitled to and based upon the successes of our students, that will be considerable!</p>

<p>All of this is possible so long as we work together as a team &ndash; parents, son or daughter and Greystone!</p>
