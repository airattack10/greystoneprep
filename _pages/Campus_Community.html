<h2>Campus Community Life</h2>

<hr /><img src="http://os_extranet_images.s3.amazonaws.com/132646_original.jpg" style="float: right; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; height: 286px; width: 250px; margin: 10px;" />
<p>As a Greystone student, you are also a Schreiner student. The first thing you should notice is this is a university campus! As a Greystone student, you have complete access to all University programs and facilities on the campus and you are expected to become part of the Schreiner campus community.</p>

<p>As a college student, you are no longer living at home. That may be good or not-so-good, but you are now a college student and therefore responsible for yourself. Everything that comes to you from this point on will be as a result of your efforts &ndash; right?</p>

<p><img src="http://os_extranet_images.s3.amazonaws.com/331130_original.jpg" style="float: left; height: 166px; width: 250px; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px;" />Fortunately, you will quickly discover Greystone teammates and&nbsp;Schreiner friends who will assist you in your efforts to &ldquo;survive&rdquo; on your own away from home. One of the major realizations of a college student living on campus is that they are never alone unless they choose to be. For you to survive and succeed in this challenging academic, physical and emotional venture, you will need the help and support of teammates and friends who share similar goals and ambitions as your own. The sooner you learn to become part of the Greystone team and Schreiner community, the sooner you will begin the transition from a high school student to a college freshman. Welcome to the &ldquo;Show&rdquo;!</p>

<p>The purpose of Schreiner University is to provide a rigorous liberal arts education to assist students as they grow into mature, competent, cultured and engaged individuals. The Schreiner experience presupposes that healthy human growth involves the whole person, claiming all the intellectual, social, physical and spiritual dimensions of each student&#39;s life. Campus activities and programming promote student initiative by providing opportunities for the integration of these dimensions in the development of a well-rounded life.</p>

<p>The Schreiner campus community supports&nbsp;33 student groups and organizations, including Greek fraternities and sororities, service clubs, interest clubs, honor societies, religion-affiliated groups, a student newspaper, a literary magazine and, of course, student government.</p>

<p>There are also organized campus events and activities all the time, including theatre productions, Spring Fling, monthly Texas Music Coffeehouses, live musical performances, speaker series, athletic events, intramurals, student group meetings, pool tournaments, movie nights, dinners, dances, and personal fitness and martial arts classes.</p>

<p>Most students live on campus, either in the residence halls or in on-campus apartments. Wherever you live, you&#39;ll find a unique environment with its own personality that reflects the individual characteristics of its residents. As Greystone students, you will live in the L.A. Schreiner Dormitory (or Flato, which is right next door).&nbsp; Students live in 4-student suites (each room houses 2 students) and share a bathroom and foyer.&nbsp; All beds are loft-beds - just like the academies - and as a Greystoner, you are expected to keep your room neat and clean (Flato rooms do not have loft-beds).&nbsp; To ensure that the standard is maintained, Greystone rooms are inspected daily by the Staff. Decoration and some furnishings are left up to each student to create their home-away-from-home environment. The world is now your oyster &ndash; make the most of it and enjoy!</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;">Half way between heaven and earth is Kerrville Texas. It doesn&#39;t sound like much at first, but after a short while you will come to love its small world charm and big town amenities (Kerrville has it&#39;s very own Super Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Cracker Barrel &ndash; need we say more?!).</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;">What attracts so many visitors to Kerrville is the Hill Country where city folk come to get away from the hustle and bustle of modern suburbia. In the spring, the rolling countryside is covered with endless varieties of colorful wild flowers and in the summer, when the cities are too hot for happy humans, Kerrville is a cool escape because of the refreshing summer breeze. The fall season seems to linger throughout the winter months &ndash; the temperature is never very cold for long and in the event of snow, a local holiday is declared. Somewhere between heaven and earth you&#39;ll find Kerrville and in the middle of it all, is Schreiner University.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;">Approximately sixty miles northwest of San Antonio, Kerrville is the home of Schreiner University. A resort community nestled among the hills of south central Texas and along the Guadalupe River; its nearly 25,000 citizens enjoy generally dry weather, cool nights, and sunny days. An easy walk from the center of town, the campus is on Texas Highway 27 south and is near Interstate 10.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;">Kerrville and the surrounding Hill Country provide a wide-open playground for outdoor fun&mdash;canoeing, kayaking, and water-skiing on the Guadalupe River, rock climbing, camping, fishing, hiking, biking, off-roading&hellip;you name it. You&#39;ll also find museums, nature centers, theatres, lakes, parks, ranches&hellip;it&#39;s all right here for you.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;">Kerrville is also a lively home for the arts, from its Point Theater to the Kerrville Folk Festival and the official sponsor of the Texas Arts &amp; Crafts Fair.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;">When you want to get away, San Antonio and all of its world-class attractions&mdash;the River Walk, Six Flags Fiesta Texas, shopping&mdash;are less than an hour away.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;">In addition, Austin, with its edgy culture and incredible music scene, is just 90 minutes away.</span></span></p>
