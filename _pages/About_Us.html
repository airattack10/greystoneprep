<h2>About Us</h2>

<hr />
<p>In 2004, the Greystone program began operation as the newest and most unique civilian service academy preparatory school in the nation.&nbsp; Our mission was simple then: Empower young men and women to earn their appointment to the service academy of their choice.</p>

<p>In the time that has passed, Greystone has evolved and so too has our mission.&nbsp;It was not long after our beginning that&nbsp;the basic mission&nbsp;that served to&nbsp;empower our students into the academies&nbsp;was determined to be lacking &ndash; at least from the Greystone perspective.&nbsp; We felt strongly that we should do more for our candidates who desired such a noble ambition &ndash; to serve our country as an academy-trained and educated leader.&nbsp; Greystone determined to expand the mission to include our ambition to empower our students to not just earn their academy appointments; but to ensure that our students graduated from the academies.&nbsp;To make that happen, Greystone had to go where no other academy prep program had ever gone before &ndash; we had to get involved in the candidate&rsquo;s application process for nomination as well as academy appointments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It became our ambition to provide the structure, organization and oversight that would ensure that all paperwork leaving Greystone having anything to do with nominations and appointments had to first go through the Greystone office to ensure accuracy, quality and timeliness of submission.&nbsp;In addition to the administrative oversight, it became clear that Greystone needed to get involved in the resolution of DoDMERB issues that prevented candidates from obtaining their academy appointments. Greystone had to serve as their advocate for all issues resulting from their interaction with their nominating sources, DoDMERB and the academies.</p>

<p>These additional considerations and needs enhanced the mission of the Greystone program to more than&nbsp;simply&nbsp;empowering candidates to earn their academy appointments. Greystone must also provide candidates with the skills and experience necessary to excel through four years of academy challenges, graduate and earn their commission.</p>
