<h2>University of the Ozarks Affiliation</h2>

<hr />
<p>In addition to the physical and character development, the heart of the Greystone program is provided through our unique relationship with the University of the Ozarks, in Clarksville, AR. Our affiliation with the University of the Ozarks provides all Greystone students with the high intensity &ldquo;Greystone Curriculum&rdquo; which is specifically designed through guidance provided from the academies to be far more challenging than traditional freshman year studies. The University of the Ozarks freshmen academics parallel&nbsp;the first-year coursework at the Military Academy, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Merchant Marine Academy and the Coast Guard&nbsp;Academy. By affiliating our&nbsp;academic&nbsp;program&nbsp;with the University, Greystone is not only able to tailor a program to meet the needs of the academies, but also thanks to the depth and flexibility provided by the University, Greystone can also meet the individual needs of our students.</p>

<p>At the University of the Ozarks, students are not numbers; they are unique individuals who receive the attention from the faculty and staff necessary to excel as scholars. Because of their status as academy-bound candidates, more is expected from Greystone students by faculty. This elevated level of expectation motivates our students to higher levels of academic performance which is key to successfully engaging academy-level challenges. Whether a Greystone candidate comes from a big city or a small-town high school, all benefit from the individualized attention, university-level academics and elevated performance expectations. If the objective is true academy preparation, it only makes sense to pursue a program that will challenge and expand your scholastic capabilities so that this year is truly meaningful and directly applicable to your future academy experience.</p>

<p>Greystone students live in the Cory-Wortz Residence Hall&nbsp;on the University of the Ozarks campus. By having all Greystone students living in the same suites, our students develop a strong bond as a team. The team concept is utilized to maximize the learning opportunity provided by the University in that all Greystone students work together to maintain focus on goals and objectives while the strength of the team is used to overcome academic weaknesses of individual team members.</p>

<p>
<p>Greystone students attend classes with other ozarks students. In this regard, they experience a true college lifestyle. The objective of the Greystone program is to eliminate all superfluous distractions&nbsp;that do not directly improve their credentials as candidates. As an academy Commandant remarked while the Greystone program was being developed, &ldquo;Allow your candidates to focus and apply themselves on what they need to accomplish to earn their appointments and leave the military training to the academies so the candidate can&nbsp;learn it the right way when they get here&rdquo;. It makes little sense to devote hours upon hours to&nbsp;distractions that in the end will not help improve a candidate&#39;s competitive edge. It makes sense to maintain focus on college-level academics because superior performance in the classroom is noticed by the academy admissions boards and can give the first-year academy students a significant advantage when classes begin. Conversely, should a candidate not earn their appointment, the student has successfully completed their entire&nbsp;freshman year of college and earned 38 fully-transferable college credits. There is much to be said for an academy prep program that is specifically designed to maximize the year of academic &ldquo;preparation&rdquo; to ensure the candidate has maximized his or her full range of options and opportunities as a scholar, athlete and leader!&nbsp; Such preparation is something a candidate can take with them wherever their future takes them and that is never a waste of time or effort!</University of the Ozarks  maintains a 15&nbsp;to 1 student to faculty ratio, providing high quality university education through personalized instruction. Unlike most major colleges or universities, a University of the Ozarks professor, not a teaching assistant or graduate student provides all classroom instruction, even for freshmen. Most of the Universityof the Ozarks professors have earned their PhD and have an average of 17 years of college teaching experience. What that means is that the professor can present a subject to a student in many different ways, thus ensuring a successful learning experience.</p>

<p>Aside from intensive classroom instruction, University of the Ozarks also provides individual tutoring beyond the classroom through the <a href="http://https://ozarks.edu/academics/student-success-center/">Student Success Center</a>. Tutors/upperclassmen&nbsp;with demonstrated expertise in the particular field of study provide one-to-one or small group tutoring assistance at no additional charge. Greystone students in need of additional academic help can always find it from their professor after class, the Student Success Center and their Greystone classmates.</p>

<p>Courses that Greystone students enroll in are reviewed annually to ensure what is taught by Schreiner is in sync with what is being taught at the academies. As changes are made to academy courses, Schreiner is informed and changes are implemented. By working closely with the academies, Greystone ensures that the courses presented by Schreiner are completely relevant and applicable to what is taught at the academies. When candidates arrive at the academies, as 81% of our graduates that earn a scholarship leading to a commission do, they are fully prepared to engage every course in order to maximize their academy academic opportunity.<br />

<p>Schreiner University was founded by Captain Charles Schreiner: Pioneer, Rancher, Banker, Merchant, and Philanthropist. On December 31, 1917, he placed in trust for the establishment of Schreiner Institute, one hundred forty and one-fourth acres of land and two hundred fifty thousand dollars &lsquo;&lsquo;to supply facilities for high-grade instruction to boys and young men as a preparation for college and university course work.&#39;&#39; The school was to be &lsquo;&lsquo;owned, maintained, and controlled by the Synod of Texas of the Presbyterian Church of the United States.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>On December 27, 1921, trustees appointed by the Synod of Texas formally received the trust and took steps to erect the first unit of buildings&mdash;a classroom building, one dormitory and the president&#39;s home. Under the leadership of James J. Delaney, a faculty was organized, and the school opened its doors in September 1923.</p>

<p>For a decade, Schreiner offered boys and young men a preparatory department and the first two years of college. In 1932, coed residents of the immediate Kerrville vicinity were enrolled in the college department as day students. In 1971, women were enrolled as boarding students.</p>

<p>Other changes helped to redefine the educational mission. From the beginning, instruction in military training was required for both high school and college students. In 1957, participation was made optional for college students and then in 1969 was discontinued. Two years later, it terminated as well for high school students. In 1973, phase-out began for the preparatory department, the name of the school was changed to Schreiner College, and the curriculum was broadened to include career education and life-long learning opportunities. In 2001, the Board of Trustees changed the name to Schreiner University.</p>

<p>The transition took Schreiner in one decade from a military preparatory school for men to a fully coeducational, four-year, liberal arts college, which received accreditation as a baccalaureate degree-granting institution in 1984.</p>

<p>Largely responsible for the school&#39;s character and reputation, Dr. James J. Delaney served as president twenty-eight years, from opening until his retirement in 1950. Genial and tolerant, Dr. Andrew Edington succeeded, serving as president twenty-one years, beautifying, modernizing, and enlarging campus facilities.</p>

<p>Continuing a tradition of progressive change while holding to enduring values, Dr. Sam McDowell Junkin, Schreiner&#39;s third president, served for twenty-five years until his retirement in 1996. Dr. J. Thompson Biggers served as the fourth president from 1996-2000. Dr. Junkin returned in 2000 to serve as Interim President.</p>

<p>In 2001, Dr. Charles Timothy Summerlin was named the fifth President of Schreiner. In his tenure, Dr. Summerlin maintained the strong connection to the Presbyterian Church while strengthening various academic programs and expanding and beautifying the campus.

<p>It is with great pride that Greystone was invited onto the Schreiner University campus to participate in their outstanding tradition of providing the best college-level education to aspiring students. As a school that serves the preparatory needs of the United States service academies, we are honored to reintroduce the campus to students destined to serve their country as academy graduates and commissioned officers in the Armed Forces of this great country.</p>
