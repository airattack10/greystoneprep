<h2>Appointment</h2>

<hr />
<p>One of the Greystone program's most important goals is to provide each candidate with the opportunity to maximize their competitiveness so they earn their academy appointment. When the candidate earns their appointment, they begin living their dream of serving our nation as an academy trained and educated leader. The true measure of any academy cadet or midshipman is a function of their graduation from the academy - which is the secondary goal of the Greystone program. Both goals - entering the academy and graduating from the academy - go hand-in-hand with the purpose behind the Greystone opportunity to maximize the full potential of each candidate regardless of where they begin the process. Most Greystone students enter our program having just graduated from high school. As high school graduates, the next logical step in their education is to begin college. Their career ambitions should determine which path they take; however, their path should be at the highest level possible for academy-bound students. That is precisely where the academy will take them – to the college level. Students seeking their academy appointments must realize that the challenges that await them are formidable. One of the primary reasons so many academy candidates fail either in the application process or when they arrive at the academy can be directly attributed to their lack of adequate preparation!</p>

<p>At Greystone, we take the candidates' dreams of service to our nation very seriously. We take their dreams so seriously that we created our program to challenge each student at the highest academic level possible. Rather than under-challenge students, Greystone seeks to over-challenge, which causes each student to grow as a scholar. No other service academy prep program had ever motivated students to exceed their scholastic comfort zone, but Greystone does! Through our affiliation with the University of the Ozarks, our students receive a high-level private university education. This experience prepares students at the right level to fully engage the academic rigors they can expect to encounter when they enter the academy. Greystone students learn how to function at the academy level and excel – they will have learned how to inspire themselves to succeed as scholars. Their University of the Ozarks experience enables Greystone students to propel themselves to their highest academic achievement level. When it comes to competing for an academy appointment, candidates who perform best academically usually are the first to succeed in earning their academy appointment. At Greystone, students quickly learn that their time on the University of the Ozarks campus is not measured in months or weeks or days, but minutes. Academy candidates cannot afford to waste time. The time they are given now to prepare themselves to become exceptional academy trained and educated leaders must not be squandered but instead used to their advantage. Leadership is, after all, a life-long learning ambition. Only the "best of the best" will win when it comes to leadership – and at Greystone, we are serious about winning. Winning is reflected in our candidates' success rate who earn their academy appointments (89% of Greystone graduates). Winning is also reflected by Greystone graduates' success rate who enter the academies and graduate (96%).</p>

<h3><span style="color:#0000CD;"><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Academy Applications</strong></span></span></h3>

<p>Over the summer training session, Greystone students pre-apply to all five of the federal service academies. The purpose behind the five pre-applications is to allow each student to begin learning about all the options and opportunities available to them through that specific academy experience. The intent is to enable the candidate to make an "informed" decision based upon fact and ground truth information – and minimize the role of urban myth and rumor.</p>

<p> By July, students will identify a minimum of three service academies that they are most interested in, and by the beginning of the academic year, they will have completed most of their academy applications for those academies. With the Greystone Staff's help, academy applications will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the package submitted to the academies is correct, accurate, and professionally written – and submitted on time! No academy application or nomination document leaves a candidate's hands without first going through the Greystone Staff. Completing most of the academy applications before the start of the academic year allows candidates to focus more time on their studies, thus allowing them to excel in the classroom (making them more competitive as academy candidates).</p>


<p>Applying to more than one academy is highly recommended by the academies, given the competitive nature of the selection process and the sheer number of high-quality applicants. Applying to more than one academy also helps maximize the possibility that at the end of the Greystone experience, each candidate will be attending one of their academies of interest. Greystone will not push any candidate into an academy but will work with them to ensure that the appointment that they earn is an appointment they will accept.</p>

<p>Our ambition is to realize your dream of service to our nation as an academy trained and educated leader. It must be YOUR dream because it is YOUR life and YOUR future. At Greystone, we will help you realize your dream by providing you with every opportunity to maximize your competitiveness as a scholar, athlete, and leader. We are here for you!</p>
