<p>Time wasted here at Greystone or at the academies translates into lost opportunity to excel as a leader &ndash; to take advantage of the many opportunities afforded to them at the academies to grow as a leader.&nbsp; Time lost means that they will not be the best they can be for them (those they will someday lead) after graduation.&nbsp; They understand that it is for them that they now strive.&nbsp; It is for them that they purse excellence. It is for them that they learn to become the best they can possibly be &ndash; and that requires that they learn the art of leadership motivation and inspiration.&nbsp; The Greystone team is a living lab that empowers each Greystone student to take the helm of leadership and try &ndash; try to be the leader that they dream about.&nbsp; While their teammate is leading, the rest of the team is following and supporting &ndash; and together they all grow as leaders!&nbsp; Positive motivation and inspiration help to forge the bonds of friendship within a team that enables the raising of the bar and the perpetual growth of excellence.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Always Ready&hellip;For Them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just not our motto, it is our way of life!<br />
