<p>A major component of the Leadership Training course involves student participation in community service.&nbsp; Candidates who aspire to serve their country as an academy trained and educated leaders are engaged in service to others.  Through their community service, Greystone students demonstrate to the academies that they are well rounded and capable of doing much more than just focusing on academics or athletics. Greystone students use their leadership skills and abilities to serve others</p>

<p>As Greystone students, the team participates in community service programs with local elementary schools, the Salvation Army, American Cancer Society (Relay for Life), Rotary International, Veterans Administration Hospital, Vietnam Veterans Association, YMCA, Wounded Warriors Project, and Boy Scouts of America.  Greystone students take on considerable responsibility as leaders and organizers.  Through their involvement in these organizations that need help and assistance to complete their mission, Greystone students understand the meaning of compassion – putting the needs of others before themselves – and of servant leadership – putting the needs of those they lead before themselves.</p>

<p>Community service within the Ozarks Mountain Country also helps to showcase our students within the Clarksville community.  Greystone is looked upon as a source of community pride.  Greystone is willing to take time from an already hectic schedule to lend a helping hand means much to those in need and those who seek to serve them.  Greystone students establish themselves as role models within the community. It is then understandable why Greystone students are in such high demand for organizations that serve children and young adults.  Helping others within their age group helps Greystone students understand how fortunate they are to be allowed to compete for an academy appointment.  It is a humbling experience to help those less fortunate, and it is incredibly humbling to know that what you are doing as a volunteer truly makes a difference that can last a lifetime.  Those who receive assistance from Greystone, young and old alike, have been changed because they know that these young men and women will go on to do something great with their life.  We hope that through our interaction with the community, we can change some lives for the better.</p>

<p>Greystone students accumulate over 100 community service hours between the time they arrive in August and when they leave in May.&nbsp; This contribution is seen as a way of giving back to this community and our nation for the many opportunities they are afforded as academy candidates.&nbsp; Through their service to the community, Clarksville and the Ozarks Mountain Country is better off as a community &ndash; and the community is grateful for their contribution.<br />
