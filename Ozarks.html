<h2>University of the Ozarks Affiliation</h2>

<hr />
<p>In addition to the physical and character development, the Greystone program's heart is provided through our unique relationship with the University of the Ozarks in Clarksville, AR. Our affiliation with the UofO provides all Greystone students with the high intensity "Greystone Curriculum," designed explicitly through the academies' guidance to be far more challenging than traditional college freshman studies. The Greystone core curriculum parallels the first-year coursework at the academies. By affiliating our academic program with the UofO, Greystone can tailor a plan to meet the academies' needs. Still, thanks to the depth and flexibility provided by the UofO, Greystone can also meet our students' individual needs.</p>

<p>At the University of the Ozarks, students are not numbers; they are unique individuals who receive the attention from the faculty and staff necessary to excel as scholars. Because of their status as academy-bound candidates, more is expected from Greystone students by faculty. This elevated level of expectation motivates our students to higher academic performance levels, which is key to successfully engaging academy-level challenges. Whether a Greystone candidate comes from a big city or a small-town high school, all benefit from the individualized attention university-level academics, and elevated performance expectations. </p>

<p>Greystone students live in the Cary-Wortz Residence Hall on the University of the Ozarks campus. By having all Greystone students live in the same dorm, our students develop a strong team bond. The team concept is utilized to maximize the learning opportunity provided by the University in that all Greystone students work together to maintain focus on their educational goals and objectives.</p>

<p>In addition to the intensive classroom instruction, the University of the Ozarks also provides individual tutoring beyond the classroom through the Student Success Center. Tutors with demonstrated expertise in the particular field provide one-to-one or small group tutoring assistance at no additional charge. Greystone students in need of extra academic help can always find it from their professor after class, the Student Success Center, and their Greystone classmates.</p>

</p>Greystone core courses are reviewed annually to ensure UofO course content is in sync with academy courses. As changes are made to academy courses, UofO faculty review those changes and modify courses as they deem appropriate. By working closely with the academies, Greystone ensures that the courses presented by the UofO are relevant and applicable to those being taught at the academies. When candidates arrive at the academies, they are fully prepared to engage in every course to maximize their academy academic opportunity.</p>
