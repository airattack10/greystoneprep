<h2>Motivation &amp; Inspiration</h2>

<hr />
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/132502_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: right;" />Greystone does not practice “negative leadership” where those in need of guidance are provided with threats and intimidation.  Much of the military and some military-like prep programs use such leadership techniques to achieve their desired goals – Greystone does not!  According to Psychologist William James, "The human individual lives far within his limits.  He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use."  Greystone elects to take a different path dedicated to motivating and inspiring those in need of guidance so that in the end, the candidate is empowered to use those underused powers and excel toward excellence.</p>

<p>By praising candidates rather than belittling them, the candidates are more apt to realize their latent possibilities.  Dale Carnegie stated that "Abilities wither under criticism, however, when encouraged properly, abilities blossom".  It is our desire to encourage our candidates to “test their wings” as scholars, athletes and leaders.  It is often the easiest approach to scream and yell to accomplish tasks when acting as a leader; however, it is often not the best way to accomplish a task beyond the minimum level of completion.  It is the true challenge of any leader to use their leadership skills to motivate and inspire those he/she leads to do their very best – not just enough to get by.</p>

<p>At Greystone, we are never satisfied with just getting by – we aspire to excel to what is called “achievement”.  Greystone must set the bar high if our candidates are to become the “best of the best” worthy of leading those they are responsible for.  Our standard for motivation and inspiration begins with the Staff and filters down to all who are part of our team.  It is the team, when properly motivated and inspired, that puts forth their best individual effort which translates into the best team effort to achieve the successes needed to earn their academy nomination and appointments.  Greystone students learn early on that they are no longer pursuing excellence or achievement for themselves, but rather for those they will someday lead.</p>

<p>Time wasted here at Greystone or at the academies translates into lost opportunity to excel as a leader. To take advantage of the many opportunities afforded to them at the academies initiates growth as a leader. Time lost means that they will not be the best they can be for “them” (those they will someday lead) after graduation.  They understand that it is for “them” that they now strive.  It is for “them” that they pursue excellence. It is for “them” that they learn to become the best they can possibly be – and that requires that they learn the art of leadership motivation and inspiration.</p>

<p>The Greystone team is a living lab that empowers each Greystone student to take the helm of leadership and try – try to be the leader that they dream about.  While their teammate is leading, the rest of the team is following and supporting – and together they all grow as leaders!  Positive motivation and inspiration help to forge the bonds of friendship within a team that enables each member of the Greystone team to raise the bar and perpetuate the growth of excellence.</p>

Always Ready...For Them. It's just not our motto, it is our way of life!<br />
