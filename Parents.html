<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/133104_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: left;" />What is Greystone?
We are the youngest and most unique academy preparatory school in the country. We have been serving the needs of academy bound students for the past 16 years. During this time, we have sent 476 Greystone graduates to the academies…students who only a few years ago were just like your son or daughter! We take them as they are, invest much time and effort into their academic, athletic and leadership development – and then oversee every component of their nomination and academy application, interview skills preparation, SAT/ACT prep, DODMERB issue resolution, physical rehab, teach them about time management, public speaking, honor and conduct and then deal with every other crisis large or small until they succeed in fulfilling their dream. Greystone is not a 9 to 5 job, but rather a commitment to their future and that takes so much more than time and dedication. What makes us unique is our close working relationship with our students – we serve to motivate and inspire them toward excellence daily and when your sons and daughters are successful, they will have grown into young men and women who are mature, honorable and confident. They will be ready to engage in the challenges that await them at the academies…and beyond!

Your Part…

Greystone parents are a vital part of the total Greystone experience in that you represent a major component of the support “Triad”. The Triad consists of your son or daughter, the Greystone Staff and you – the parents. For Greystone to accomplish our mission, we must be able to “push” your son or daughter beyond their comfort zone and into that “unknown zone”. By “push” I mean we must be able to motivate and inspire them to take multiple steps closer toward academic, athletic and leadership excellence. To accomplish this task daily, we must know what is going on in their heads and in their hearts – and this is where parents play a vital role. As normal academy-bound college freshman, it is not unusual for our students to assume the aura of being “ten feet tall and bullet-proof” while on campus, however, as experienced mentors and advisors, the Greystone Staff is aware that these young people sometimes fail to pass their problems on to Staff but do share with their “Moms and Dads”. Parents must work hand-in-glove with the Greystone Staff to ensure that when such information regarding health, injuries or emotional setbacks are shared, parents must then pass that information along to Greystone. As an example, a few years ago one of our more stellar Greystone students who traditionally performed at the upper level in everything for some reason presented himself at the lower level during morning PT. When asked if there was a problem, he replied that there was none – and nothing else was presented to explain his performance. When the parents were called later that morning, they informed me that his Grandmother had passed away the night before and their son was very close to her! No wonder why he was not performing up to his normal standard! For Greystone to “push”, we must know when things happen on the “home front”. Everything from a girl/boyfriend issues, a sickness or death in the family, death of a pet – anything that would impact your Greystoners’ performance is something that needs to be passed to Greystone so we can assist and get that candidate back in the game. The Greystone Staff traditionally enjoys a very close relationship with each student and because of this relationship; we can assist your son or daughter – as well as you! Trust me, it is of great comfort to know that there are people who care deeply about your son or daughter in times of crisis. We are as close as the phone!

</p>All Cards on the Table…

Greystone is moving after 16 years to a new campus – the University of the Ozarks! The reason for this move is strictly financial – the cost of room, board, tuition and fees were exceeding what our students and their families could afford. Despite our best efforts to
negotiate some sort of financial relief for our students, it was soon made clear that Greystone needed to find a new home. We conducted a nation-wide search and our first iteration revealed that 134 schools met our initial criteria. We expanded our criteria and after several more iterations, narrowed our search to three finalists – and the University of the Ozarks won! Actually, future Greystone students and their families won because we discovered a new university with greater capacity – academically, athletically and logistically – the met and exceeded all of our criteria. And they did so at a much lower cost to our students! How is that possible? Ozarks saw in Greystone the full potential to add enhanced potential to their campus community – and they were willing to offer significant scholarship to make Greystone their new partner. I am certain that this new home will afford our students with so much more than we ever enjoyed at our previous home – and our students will be even more successful because of it!

<p>The Greystone Staff…
As Staff, we see ourselves as an extension of the family unit and we will certainly support your family to ensure you are able to deal effectively with problems and crisis as they arise. Conversely, the Greystone Staff will ensure that we communicate with the parents when we notice changes in their son or daughter. Effective two-way communication between the parents and Greystone will ensure that your son or daughter is able to maximize what this program is designed to deliver – sustained superior performance in the classroom, on the athletic field and as leaders. Parents can rest assured that as a Staff, we take our responsibilities seriously and therefore you always have access to the entire Greystone Staff – period. We are here for you too!
</p>
<p>Ups and Downs…
One of the most challenging and exasperating moments of your life has to be the experience of the nomination and academy application process. Parents have informed Greystone of their frustration as they attempted to help their sons or daughters fill out their applications properly, obtain all those transcripts and letters of recommendation, deal with DODMERB, communicate with the congressman and senators, talk to the academies and their recruiters – it was mind numbing and exhausting! Unfortunately, that is the way the game is played, but there is a silver lining – Greystone will now take on much of this burden. 
The Staff understands how the entire process works and it is our responsibility to ensure that each candidate submits a completed package for each nomination and each academy – on time! We work with DODMERB to ensure that all steps are taken should there be a need for a waiver. We work closely with the academies and their recruiters to answer all questions and to monitor their application status. We go the extra mile to oversee the entire process to ensure that every part of every application is complete and without error. Greystone assumes the duties as your son’s or daughter’s advocate and we help them get the job done. Your student will be focusing on maximizing their academics, physical conditioning, involvement in community service and the many other facets involved in the Greystone experience. In the end, your son or daughter will earn everything that they are entitled to and based upon the successes of our students, that will be considerable!

<p>All of this is possible so long as we work together as a team – parents, son or daughter and Greystone!</p>
