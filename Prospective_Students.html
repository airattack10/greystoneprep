<p>On behalf of the entire Greystone family – the Staff, our Board of Directors and Advisory Board members, Greystone volunteers, Greystone parents, Greystone Alumni, University of the Ozarks Faculty and Staff and most importantly, the current Greystone Class - I would like to welcome you to the official Greystone website.</p>

<p>At this time of the year, many of you are receiving that "TWE" or "Thin White Envelope" and experiencing the emotions associated with your first rejection letter. If it is any consolation, I too received a TWE - in 1976 - and can still feel the pain caused by the words on that page...after all, I was certain that I was going to the academy, and therefore, the letter had to be a mistake! Unfortunately, the TWE is what it is; however, you do not necessarily have to accept those words as your final verdict when it comes to your dream of attending the academy! Your future is entirely up to you because only you can make that decision to reapply. Only you can call it quits, however, since you are reading this, I will assume that you are not willing to give up on your dream! The question then becomes - what are you going to do to change the status quo and make yourself more competitive as an academy candidate? </p>

<p>I hope you continue to read on and discover what the academies have discovered - Greystone is an outstanding opportunity for those candidates not willing to give up on their dream!  Greystone is proud of the success rate of our students who earn their academy appointment but most proud of the the academy graduation rate of Greystone students.  It is higher than any other prep school – even the academy’s own prep schools!</p> Care to know more?

<p>The <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/129134_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: right;" />many challenges our students face as they pursue their nominations and academy appointments are often compared to the efforts put forth when climbing a mountain. In the early days of the program development, I was reading some of the memoirs from Lord Hillary, a world-renowned mountain climber and explorer. I discovered that he kept referring to “grey stone” and how he would look for it whenever he would climb because according to Hillary, this “grey stone” was granitic and therefore strong enough to hold the weight of a climber. Finding the “grey stone” was imperative because he knew he could depend on it and it would not let him down – literally! For some reason that story stuck with me and as the development of the program continued, we began to consider names and Greystone came to mind!</p>

<p>The challenge before you as an academy candidate is often daunting and at times, it seems impossible, but for those willing to fully engage this challenge and climb, the reward at the summit is worth all the struggles encountered during the ascent. As the Founder of the Greystone program, it was my intent to create a program that would be both meaningful and yet applicable to the many challenges faced by candidates. How could I use the potential and power of existing programs within college-level institutions to create an academic, athletic and leadership environment that was above and beyond the existing level of academy preparatory achievement? 
It took six years to develop the baseline program for Greystone and over the course of the last 15 years of operation, the program continues to grow and evolve. The engine behind this change has been our students – and in particular, our Greystone graduates. Their feedback based upon their recent academy experience, along with the admission’s guidance provided by the academies ensures that Greystone remains on the cutting edge of academy preparatory education excellence. Every year as our students graduate from Greystone and enter the academies, they provide us with suggestions to improve the program – taking our program to the next higher level. Due to our unique relationship with University of the Ozarks, we have been able to incorporate all of these changes into the Greystone program. So long as there are candidates in need of the Greystone challenge, we will continue to evolve and keep pace with the needs expressed by our graduates and the academies to deliver the best possible academy preparatory experience! If you are not willing to give up on your dream of serving our nation as an academy trained and educated leader, trust in Greystone and invest in this highly successful program…we won’t let you down!
