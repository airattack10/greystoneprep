<p>On behalf of the entire Greystone family – the Staff, our Board of Directors and Advisory Board members, Greystone volunteers, Greystone parents, Greystone Alumni, University of the Ozarks Faculty and Staff, and most importantly, the current Greystone Class - I would like to welcome you to the official Greystone website.</p>

<p>At this time of the year, many of you are receiving that "TWE" or "Thin White Envelope" and experiencing the emotions associated with your first rejection letter. If it is any consolation, I too received a TWE - in 1976 - and can still feel the pain caused by the words on that page...after all, I was confident that I was going to the Naval Academy, and therefore, the letter had to be a mistake! The good news is that you do not necessarily have to accept those words as your final verdict regarding your dream of attending an academy! Your future is entirely up to you because only you can make that decision to reapply. Only you can call it quits; however, since you are reading this, I will assume that you are not willing to give up on your dream! The question then becomes - what are you going to do to change the status quo and make yourself more competitive as an academy candidate?</p>

<p>I hope you continue to read on and discover what the academies have found - Greystone is an outstanding opportunity for those candidates not willing to give up on their dream! Greystone is proud of our graduates' success rate who worked hard, earned their appointments, and proceeded to the academies. We are most proud of the academy graduation rate of Greystone students. It is higher than any other prep school – even the academy's prep schools!</p> Care to know more?

<p>Our<img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/129134_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: right;" /> students many challenges as they pursue their nominations and academy appointments are often compared to the efforts put forth when climbing a mountain. In the early days of the program development, I read some of Sir Edmond Hillary's memoirs. As a world-renowned mountain climber and the first person to summit Mount Everest, he was all too familiar with extreme challenges. I discovered that he kept referring to "grey stone" and how he would look for it whenever he would climb. According to Hillary, this "grey stone" was granitic and therefore strong enough to hold a climber's weight. Finding the "grey stone" was imperative because he knew he could depend on it, and it would not let him down – literally! For some reason, that story stuck with me. As the program's development continued, we began to consider names, and Greystone came to mind!</p>

<p>The challenge before you as an academy candidate is often daunting, and at times, it seems impossible, but for those willing to fully engage this challenge and persevere, the reward at the summit is worth all the struggles encountered during the ascent. As the Greystone program's Founder, I intended to create a program that would be both meaningful and yet applicable to the many challenges faced by candidates. How could I use the potential and power of existing programs within college-level institutions to create an academic, athletic, and leadership environment above and beyond the existing academy preparatory achievement level? It took six years to develop the baseline program for Greystone. Over the last 17 years of operation, the program continues to grow and evolve. The engine behind this change has been our students – and in particular, our Greystone graduates. Their feedback based upon their recent academy experience and the admission's guidance provided by the academies ensures that Greystone remains on the cutting edge of academy preparatory education excellence. Every year as our students graduate from Greystone and enter the academies; they provide us with suggestions to improve the program – taking our program to the next higher level. Due to our relationship with the University of the Ozarks, we incorporated all Greystone program changes. So long as there are candidates interested in reapplying to the academies, we will continue delivering the best possible academy preparatory experience! If you are not willing to give up on your dream of serving our nation as an academy trained and educated leader, trust in Greystone and invest in this highly successful program…we won't let you down! </p>
