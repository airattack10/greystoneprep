<h2>Structure &amp; Oversight</h2>

What makes us unique is that from day one, all candidates from the high school graduate level to are elevated to the college freshman level!  All Greystone students are FULL-TIME university freshmen.  It was an intentional part of the program development that Greystone students would not be provided with a "grade 13" high school experience, nor would Greystone provide a community college or junior college experience - because the academies are significantly more rigorous compared to those afore mentioned.  If the candidates are serious about evolving into competitive academy candidates, they must significantly change the status quo. As a re-applicant, the intent must not be to meet the minimums necessary to enter the academy at the bottom of the incoming class – they must strive to excel and use this year to grow significantly as a scholar, athlete and leader. The competition for academy appointments is intense and therefore the additional year dedicated to re-application must propel the serious candidate above the competition to stand head-and-shoulders above all others – or it is a waste of time and effort. Re-applicants should use this year of prep to elevate themselves to the academy academic, athletic and leadership level and not be settled with anything less; because less will never afford them the title of becoming the best of the best. </p>

<p>Greystone students engage in the same freshman level academic courses they are required to take at the academies for two reasons: - to demonstrate to the academy admissions boards that they possess the college-level scholastic skills and abilities to succeed at the academy level. The second reason is to provide the candidate with the opportunity to take what they learn through the University of the Ozarks and use it to their advantage. Because of their college experience, Greystone students are afforded the option to either validate (test out of) their academy courses that they completed while enrolled at the University of the Ozarks – or – they can retake their  University courses again at the academy, but because of their knowledge and experience previously gained as a University freshman, they earn a much better grade than most of their academy classmates.  Both options provide Greystone students with a significant "leg-up". Depending on what their goals are upon graduation, each option can be worked to their advantage (higher GPA by taking courses again means a higher class standing and ultimately a broader selection of career opportunities as a senior or by validating academy freshman level courses, they are able to take additional courses in their major as upperclassmen which can lead to advanced education opportunities or broader selection of career opportunities). Because of the way Greystone is structured through University of the Ozarks, no other academy preparatory school can provide candidates with such dynamic options or opportunities! </p>

No other academy preparatory program in the country offers this level of academic achievement because no other academy preparatory program is affiliated with a four-year, fully-accredited university!  

<p>For those candidates who are serious about improving their credentials that weigh heavily to the academy admissions boards - sustained academic performance at the university level is considered more than any other area. Success in collegiate academics convinces the Admissions Board of your ability to succeed at the academy. This is why Greystone students are admitted at such a high rate and also why Greystone students graduate at a high rate - a rate that exceeds all other academy preparatory schools and that includes the academy's own prep programs (MAPS, NAPS and AFAPS).</p>

<p>The Greystone program is – by design – intended to be a high-intensity full-immersion experience focused on providing candidates with challenging university-level academics, rigorous physical conditioning (and sports) and professional development as leaders of character.  To accomplish this, Greystone cannot realistically support more than 40 students and maintain our level of academy preparatory excellence – it is just not feasible!  The key to ensuring that the quality of the program remains high is to ensure that our Staff and volunteers are of the highest quality.</p>

<p>The structure of the Greystone program is simple - combine the strength and flexibility of a four-year, fully-accredited university with a real academy preparatory program that was specially designed by academy faculty, staff and alumni intended to maximize the scholastic, athletic and leadership credentials of each candidate. Once the structure provided by the University and the preparatory school is in place, it is then up to the students to take advantage of the opportunities afforded to them.  The key to the success of the Greystone program and the success of our candidates is a function of the staff, faculty, Board and volunteers who combine their experience and knowledge to oversee the individual success of each candidate thus ensuring the expected growth and results.  </p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/132650_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: left;" />The Greystone program was developed by David Bailey who was a prep school student, Midshipman at the Naval Academy, career Naval Officer and Naval Academy Faculty member before becoming the Founder and Executive Director of Greystone.  His life time of experience as a leader and as an educator enables Greystone to provide students with the kind of experience that is both meaningful and applicable to the challenges they face at the academies.  Having had the experience as a prep school student and Midshipman affords him a unique perspective which is translated to the overall Greystone challenge – it is real!  As the Executive Director, he establishes the vision for the rest of the Staff to emulate and oversees the daily operation of the program.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brenda Bailey is the Administrative Director of the Greystone program.  She is responsible for the overall completion of all nomination and academy applications.  Having been one of the Greystone incorporators and part of the initial development of the Greystone idea, she is the motivation behind the execution of the paperwork side of Greystone.</p>

<p>Mr. Kenneth O’Neal is responsible for Time-Management program as well as the Effective Communication public speaking program. Both programs provide a much needed basis upon which our students are able to maximize their time and efforts while at Greystone and beyond. Effective Communication helps the students learn that they are capable of effective public speaking and affords each student with the opportunity to demonstrate their public speaking abilities.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tayler Gonzales is a Schreiner University  alumni and faculty member and during the Fall Semester, assists students with their nomination and academy applications. Working in conjunction with Mrs. B, students successfully submit the best possible applications to their congressional representatives, both senators and the Vice President as well as complete a minimum of three academy applications. All documents are reviewed and approved by the Staff prior to submission – thus ensuring a timely and accurate application.</p>

<p>The combined efforts of the Staff result in a dynamic program that empowers students to earn their academy nominations and appointments.  This is accomplished by providing the program with organization first and foremost.  The program must have leadership and it must have a routine which is the heartbeat of Greystone. Without leadership there is chaos – and in this time-critical year of preparation there is no time for chaos!  A strongly lead organization that is tightly structured with a dynamic routine is well on its way to providing the students with their success, except it needs one more element – oversight.  The day-to-day oversight is the key that makes the difference between a traditional prep school experience and Greystone.  Having a Staff that is knowledgeable of the academy preparatory process and then unleashing this group of dedicated and committed individuals to work with our candidates ensures that they evolve into young men and women worthy of an academy appointment.  Because of the oversight provided by the Staff, the Board of Directors, Advisory Board, University faculty and staff and all of the Greystone volunteers, students receive a great deal of hands-on supervision, guidance and counsel.  The purpose is to elevate their overall level of performance as scholars, athletes and leaders - and also as mature and refined candidates who represent Greystone, the university and the academies well.  Without the structure, organization and oversight provided by so many who care deeply about our candidates, the results of each consecutive Greystone Class would not be as impressive as they are – successful  people inspiring successful young people is a very powerful combination unmatched in the field of academy preparatory education.</p>
