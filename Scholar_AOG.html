<hr />
<p>As a WPPSP sponsored student with the West Point Association of Graduates (AOG), your curriculum at Greystone and Schreiner University reflects what you will see during your West Point Plebe year. You will be enrolled in freshman courses that are recommended by the Academy. Our Academic Director will register you for your first semester and will guide you through the registration process in the second semester. You can see the classes that our AOG students take during their year at Greystone, below.</p>

<ol>
	<li>1.	General Chemistry I & II (with lab component)</li>
	<li>2.	English Composition I & II</li>
	<li>3.	Military Science I</li>
	<li>4.	Math I & II (Pre-Calculus, Calc I, Calc II, Linear Algebra, etc.)</li>
	<li>5.	IDST (Freshman Studies coupled with Leadership Training and Character Development)</li>
	<li>6.	Second Semester Elective (Foreign Language, Political Science, International Relations, or another approved course)</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks to our relationship with Schreiner University, class schedules can be tailored to meet the specific needs of our students. Each Greystone student is evaluated across the different academic disciplines to determine the classes they should be enrolled in. For example, if a student was enrolled in one year of AP Calculus in high school and scored well on the AP Exam, they should take Calculus II as their first semester math course and then move on to Calculus III or Linear Algebra in the spring semester. To do otherwise, to 'repeat' a course, tells Academy Admissions that you're unwilling to challenge yourself, that you're taking the easy road to inflate your GPA. With this flexibility in class schedules, we can ensure that our students are challenged, but not overwhelmed. </p>

<p>If you have questions about the Greystone academic program, please contact Greystone at 830-896-6530.</p>
