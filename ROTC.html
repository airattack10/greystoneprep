<h2>Army&nbsp;ROTC</h2>

<hr />
<p>Many academy re-applicants are interested in beginning their military experience sooner rather than later. They don't want to wait until they arrive at the academies - and we understand that! The University of the Ozarks – is partnered with the University of Central Arkansas and the Bayonet Battalion to provide Greystone students with Army ROTC. This means our students will be wearing OCPs on the days they will have their ROTC classes/labs. If you are interested in learning the basics of those who serve in the Armed Forces, this is a HUGE opportunity regardless of the academy you desire to attend. Army ROTC cadets will enroll in Military Science I (MS-1), and this course will last through two semesters.</p>

<p>Students participating in ROTC will be enrolled in the first year Military Science course (MS-1) and Lab component, which are taught by Army ROTC staff at Arkansas Technical University in Russellville. Students will be issued Operational Camouflage Pattern uniforms (OCP) worn on class and lab days.</p>

<p>Participation in ROTC during your time at Greystone affords academy candidates many benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>- As an ROTC candidate you can reapply to the academies and are eligible to compete for the ROTC USMA nomination – an extra benefit afforded to only those enrolled in the ROTC program.</li>
	<li>- Those in the ROTC program can apply for a 3-year full-ride ROTC scholarship should they not earn their academy appointments – a dynamic back-up plan!</li>
	<li>- Enrollment in ROTC enables you to participate in all ROTC events – spirit events, FTXs, training opportunities, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Army ROTC opportunity is not just for Army candidates – MS I is a baseline introduction to the military and its customs and traditions. Therefore, completion of MS I is transferable to all other ROTC programs, no matter the service. Whether you attend an academy or go on to ROTC at another college or university, you can maximize the program's power and experience and be fully prepared to engage the leadership and academic challenges as an MS II or second year ROTC cadet.</p>

<p>Students that elect to enroll in MS-1 during their year at Greystone are also afforded many benefits once they leave:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<li>- Academically, they will be better prepared for the academy first-year professional  courses. Or, should they not earn their academy appointment, they can move forward as a sophomore at another college/university.</li>
	<li>- Students who transfer to the college or university of their choice, do so as a sophomore and not a freshman, and are also eligible to enroll in any ROTC as an MS-2 (sophomore).</li>
	<li>- </li>
	<li>- Academic, athletic and leadership experience gained from Greystone/MS-1 translates into immediate consideration for ROTC leadership positions as a sophomore – eliminating most “first-year” freshman initiations.</li>
	<li>- As members of the Bayonet Battalion, they will have already networked with those in that program and should they elect to pursue the Bayonet Army ROTC route – they will be warmly embraced as an established member of that unit.</li>
	<li>- ROTC students will graduate one year before their Greystone classmates who go into the academies and therefore, their year of prep will put them one year ahead of their Greystone/academy classmates when they commission as an officer.</li>
	<li>- ROTC students can reapply to the academies while in ROTC – and Greystone will continue to assist these students with nominations and academy applications via a distant learning program (several Greystone graduates have gone on to ROTC at Rice, Boston University, Texas A&M and University of Maryland and used the distance learning Greystone program to earn their academy appointments).</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, ROTC at Greystone affords those interested students the best of all worlds. Students will get the military experience they seek while they simultaneously maximize their academy application process. ROTC at Greystone is simply another safety net experience that empowers our candidates to use this year to optimize their dream of earning a military commission!</p>

<p>If you are serious about serving our country as a commissioned officer, you owe it to yourself to consider this incredible ROTC opportunity now at Greystone.</p>

<h3>Military Science Courses</h3>

<p>The first-year Military Science courses offered to Greystone students are the same courses taught nation-wide and apply to all military services, not just the Army. As it is the most fundamental training for up and coming officers, the skills learned in these courses can be applied as an officer in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. Therefore, if the Army is not your first choice in service, you can still enroll in these courses and transfer them to the ROTC unit of your choice!</p>
