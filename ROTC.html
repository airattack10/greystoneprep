<h2>Army&nbsp;ROTC</h2>

<hr />
<p>Many&nbsp;academy re-applicants are interested in beginning their military experience sooner rather than later. They don&#39;t want to&nbsp;wait until they&nbsp;arrive&nbsp;at the academies,&nbsp;and we understand that! That&#39;s why&nbsp;Greystone has partnered with the University of Texas in San&nbsp;Antonio to offer our students a full first-year&nbsp;Army ROTC experience.</p>

<p>As a Greystone student, ROTC is an option &ndash; it is not mandatory! It is a 3-credit hour elective that takes the place of&nbsp;your history course in the Greystone-Schreiner core curriculum. That goes for both sponsored candidates and free-agents, alike. Students that elect to participate in ROTC will be enrolled in the first year Military Science course (MS-1) and Lab component which are taught by UTSA Army ROTC staff on the Schreiner campus. Students will be issued Army Combat&nbsp;Uniforms (ACUs) which will be worn on class and lab days.&nbsp;Additionally, since UTSA is only 45 minutes from the&nbsp;Schreiner campus, Greystone students can easily stay involved in all major ROTC activities.</p>

<p>In addition to starting your military experience right away, there are many benefits for participating in ROTC during your year at Greystone:</p>

<ul>
	<li>- As an ROTC candidate you are able to reapply to the academies and are eligible to compete for the ROTC academy nomination &ndash; an extra benefit afforded to only&nbsp;those enrolled in the ROTC program.</li>
	<li>- Those in the ROTC program can apply for 3-year full-ride ROTC scholarships should they not earn their&nbsp;academy appointments &ndash; a dynamic back-up plan!</li>
	<li>-&nbsp;Enrollment in ROTC enables you to participate in all UTSA ROTC events&nbsp;&ndash; spirit events,&nbsp;FTXs, training&nbsp;opportunities, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, this Army ROTC opportunity is not just for Army candidates &ndash; MS-1 is a baseline introduction to the military as well as its customs and&nbsp;traditions. Therefore, completion of MS-1 is&nbsp;transferable&nbsp;to all other ROTC programs, no matter the service. Then, whether you attend an academy or go on to MS-2 at another&nbsp;college or university, you are able to maximize the power and experience of the University of Texas&nbsp;ROTC program and be fully ready to&nbsp;engage the leadership and academic challenges.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://os_extranet_images.s3.amazonaws.com/381271_original.jpg" style="width: 149px; height: 200px;" /><img src="http://os_extranet_images.s3.amazonaws.com/381261_original.jpg" style="width: 267px; height: 200px;" /><img src="http://os_extranet_images.s3.amazonaws.com/412591_original.jpg" style="width: 295px; height: 200px;" /><img src="http://os_extranet_images.s3.amazonaws.com/381262_original.jpg" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; width: 267px; height: 200px;" /></p>

<p>Students that elect to enroll in MS-1 during their year at Greystone are also afforded many benefits once they leave:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<li>-&nbsp;Academically, they will be prepared for academy first-year courses or, should they not earn their academy appointment, they can move forward as a sophomore at another college/university.</li>
	<li>-&nbsp;Students who transfer to the college&nbsp;or university of their choice, do so as a sophomore and not a freshman, and are also eligible to enroll in any ROTC as an MS-2 (sophomore).</li>
	<li>-&nbsp;Greystone students who do not earn their academy appointment can&nbsp;also transfer to UTSA in their ROTC program under a full three-year scholarship!</li>
	<li>-&nbsp;Academic, athletic and leadership experience gained from Greystone/MS-1 translates into immediate&nbsp;consideration for ROTC leadership positions as a sophomore &ndash; eliminating most &ldquo;first-year&rdquo; freshman initiations.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>-&nbsp;As members of the UTSA ROTC, they will have already networked with those in that program and should they elect to pursue the UTSA ROTC &ndash; they will be&nbsp;warmly embraced as an established member of that unit.</li>
	<li>-&nbsp;ROTC students should graduate before their Greystone classmates who go into the academies and therefore, they year of prep will put them one year ahead of their Greystone/academy classmates when they commission as an&nbsp;officer.</li>
	<li>- ROTC students can reapply to the academies while in ROTC &ndash; and Greystone will&nbsp;continue to assist with nominations and academy applications. (Several Greystone graduates&nbsp;have gone on to ROTC at Rice, Boston University, Texas A&amp;M and University of Maryland and used&nbsp;the long distance Greystone program to earn their academy appointments).</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, ROTC at Greystone affords those interested students the best of all worlds. Students will get the military experience they seek while they simultaneously maximize their academy application process. ROTC at Greystone is just another safety net experience that empowers our candidates to use this year&nbsp;of prep to maximize their dream of earning either their academy appointment or an ROTC scholarship &ndash;&nbsp;both will lead to a commission!</p>

<p>If you are serious about serving our country as a commissioned officer, you owe it to yourself to consider this incredible ROTC opportunity now at Greystone.</p>

<h3>Military Science Courses</h3>

<p>The first year Military Science courses that are offered to Greystone students are the same courses that are taught nation-wide and are applicable to all military services, not just the Army. As it is the most fundamental training for up and coming officers, the skills learned in these courses can be applied as an officer in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. Therefore, if the Army is not your first choice in service, you can still enroll in these courses and transfer them to the ROTC unit of your choice!</p>
