<p>Welcome to the Greystone website! You have discovered the only university-level academy preparatory school explicitly developed for young men and women who are unwilling to give up on their dream of attending one of the five Federal Service Academies. Should you have candidates who did not earn their academy appointments and are interested in pursuing their appointment again, Greystone is undoubtedly a unique option worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>As a Not-For-Profit 501(c)(3) and Tax-Exempt organization, Greystone accepts candidates regardless of their gender or diversity status. So long as an academy candidate meets the University of the Ozarks admission criteria, they are welcome into the program.</p>

<p>Greystone Preparatory School is unique in this country for a few reasons: we are the only academy prep school offering candidates a university-level academic experience to earn up to 38 fully transferable college credits. Through our affiliation with the University of the Ozarks, Greystone students are full-time college students. Greystone students live in their own dormitory on campus but are integrated into the University of Ozarks campus community through their classes, at the Diner, and on the athletic fields during intramural sports. As University of the Ozarks students, they receive a full “college” experience having access to all facilities and activities available to other UofO students. Greystone students complete their college freshmen year of study – a significant safety net should they not earn their academy appointment. Additionally, Greystone students are eligible to participate in the Army ROTC program and can compete for ROTC scholarships as a back-up plan should they desire!</p>

<p>Greystone is unparalleled because the entire program was developed by academy faculty, staff, and alumni for the sole purpose of raising the preparatory school experience to a high standard that would better meet the expectations of the academies. As scholars, athletes and leaders, Greystone students experience a higher level of challenge so that they transition from their prep school experience seamlessly and laterally into their academy experience. They will have mastered their academic courses – all of which are in sync with first-year academy courses. They will be in their best shape physically – ready to excel throughout their first-year summer training and beyond. They will have a complete understanding of the academy honor codes and concepts because they will have written and lived by a similar code while at Greystone – as part of their Character Development Course. Greystone students have a substantial appreciation for what the academy expects of them conduct-wise because they will have lived by their Standards of Conduct while Greystone students.</p>

<p>As an Academy Liaison, you may provide information about Greystone to candidates from your state or your congressional district as an information service to your constituents. Greystone also welcomes candidates and their parents to participate in any Greystone events and activities listed on our calendar. We hope that these special young men and women be allowed to determine for themselves their best course should they choose to reapply to the academies. Our intent is to inform; the decision is entirely up to your constituents.</p>

<p>As an Academy Liaison, Greystone is open should you choose to visit.  Visits can be scheduled through the Greystone office by call 443-822-8918 or by sending an email to the Greystone Administrative Director at  <a href="mailto:bvest@greystoneprepschool.org">bvest@greystoneprepschool.org</a>.</p>
