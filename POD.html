<h2>Plan of the Day</h2>

<hr />
<p>The Day-to-Day operation of the Greystone program is listed in a single document called the Plan of the Day or POD for short.&nbsp; This document is published twice per week and it is the responsibility of each Greystone student to know what is going on&nbsp;at all times - and the POD helps to make that happen!&nbsp; Most military organizations publish a similar document and therefore familiarization with its contents is helpful to the professional development of the candidate. The contents of each POD - including the daily schedule, the&nbsp;long range, and the announcements - help students to get themselves organized which contributes to their increased productivity.&nbsp; The POD is also sent to parents, former students and their parents and friends of Greystone - over 500 people around the world are&nbsp;interested in what&#39;s happening at Greystone on a daily basis.&nbsp; From the front line in Afghanistan to the Ready Room aboard an aircraft carrier in the Gulf - the Greystone POD is everywhere!&nbsp; If you or someone you know would like to be added to the POD mailing list, <u><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0sF5jwGCd2dC8wRLqrww4HkfjPRX1iymZ2aa_y367SeoC0Q/viewform">please click here</a></strong></u>. Once you have submitted your name and email, we will add you to the mailing list within two days. Enjoy!</p>
