<p><span style="color:#0000CD;"><u><strong><span>CONGRATULATIONS! &nbsp;Class of 2020 nominations are in and 100% of the Greystone class has earned at least one nomination!</span></strong></u></span></p>

<p>For those candidates seeking an appointment to the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy or the Merchant Marine Academy, they are required to obtain a nomination in order to complete their academy application requirements and be considered for an appointment.  The Coast Guard Academy does not require a nomination as part of their application process.</p>

<p>Unlike any other academy preparatory school in the nation, Greystone requires candidates to apply to all nomination sources for which they are eligible.  All candidates will apply to their congressional representative from their home district, both of their home state senators and the Vice President - a minimum of FOUR nominations!  Additionally, for students who are eligible, they will also apply for the Presidential nomination (one application is sent to each academy to which they are applying). </p>

To ensure completion of this task prior to the start of the academic year, Greystone begins working with each candidate during the summer training process which begins in June. During this period, students participate in a series of online GoToWebinars in the comfort of their own home. Each session is designed to address every component of the entire nomination package requested by each separate nominating source and then provide opportunities to work with the candidates on their individual applications. Where most recent high school graduates are occupied with "other" things (distractions), Greystone students are busy completing their administrative requirements necessary to apply for all nominations. Completing these tasks over the summer enables the Greystone students to focus on their academics once the University of the Ozarks academic year begins. This is key to enhancing a student's academic performance so that they can be as competitive as possible!!</p>

<p>Since the start of the Greystone program in 2004, 99.98% of all Greystone students have earned at least one academy nomination and most Greystoners earn multiple nominations. For every nomination earned, the qualified candidate is afforded one opportunity for his or her academy application package to be presented to the academy admissions board. Without a nomination, a candidate cannot be presented to the admissions board, which makes the nomination a critical key in the appointment process. For that reason, Greystone is dedicated to the creation, perfection and submission of each candidate's nomination packages.</p>

<p>While finalizing their nomination packages, each Greystone student receives a list of questions that have been compiled from many years of student nomination interviews. These questions, along with a series of documents that each student writes over the summer, helps the candidate to realize exactly what attending the academy means, what their service commitment means and what their future as a military officer means to them. Through this process, the student develops a strong sense of self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem, which is essential to each Greystone candidate who must present him/herself as serious contender for that nomination.</p>

<p>Prior to their nomination interview, all Greystone students will be presented before a formal board which is comprised of senior military officers, University faculty and staff as well as community leaders. The board members will ask the candidate questions and then evaluate their responses. Each member of the board is asked to write an evaluation which will be briefed to the candidate by the board after the interview is complete. The performance evaluations allow each member of the board to grade the candidate on their appearance, poise and composure to the way in which they answered each question. The intent is to provide candidates with a means to identify areas that need immediate attention and to reinforce those areas that are exceptional. The Murder Board is a professional “Dress Rehearsal” for the actual nomination interview whether that is in person, over the phone or a video teleconference. </p>

<p>Clearly, given the success rate of our students earning their nominations, Greystone students are truly prepared for their nomination interviews. How a candidate presents him/herself to their actual nomination board means all the difference when it is time for the Congressman or Senator's board to determine who is nominated and who is not. At Greystone, we are very serious about the entire nomination process and therefore, our students are very knowledgeable and prepared to impress not only those on the nomination boards, but all who they meet and interact with during their year at Greystone. Greystone students know that as academy candidates, more is expected of them professionally and therefore, it is imperative that our candidates begin and sustain a process of professional development and maturity. These characteristics will signify to all they meet and interact with, that they are academy material and worthy of full consideration for not only a nomination, but ultimately, their appointment. Greystone students just don't dream about going to an academy - they live it every day that they are part of the Greystone program. Much is expected of them, but much is earned by those candidates who are serious about competing for their nomination and appointment.</p>

<p>If you are searching for a prep school that is entirely focused on putting forth all effort to assist you across the broad spectrum of the nomination and academy application requirements, then you should seriously consider Greystone.</p>
