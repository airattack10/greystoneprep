<h3><span style="font-size:22px;"><strong><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">How to Apply</span></strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Students are encouraged to begin the application process as soon as possible in the Spring of their senior year. Evaluation of an applicant&#39;s potential for success includes a review of your high school grade-point-average (GPA) and rank in the high school graduating class as well as a complete listing of all standardized test scores (ACT and/or SAT). To apply, students must submit the following documents to the&nbsp;Schreiner University Office of Admissions at:</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;"><strong>Schreiner University<br />
Office of Admission<br />
2100 Memorial Blvd.<br />
Kerrville, TX 78028</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">1. A completed Schreiner/Greystone Application for Admission and a $25 non-refundable application fee. To start the application,&nbsp;<a href="https://jrm.targetx.com/orgs/00Dj00000028oS8EAI/login">click here</a>. WHEN SELECTING THE APPLICATION TYPE, BE SURE TO CHOOSE OPTION <strong>#5 - GREYSTONE</strong>, NOT FRESHMAN.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">2. An official high school transcript from an accredited high school showing cumulative grade-point-average and current rank in class through the <strong>FALL SEMESTER OF SENIOR YEAR</strong>. In other words, a transcript that documents <strong>seven</strong> semesters.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">3. Official test scores (ACT or SAT) sent directly to Schreiner University from the testing company or recorded on the official high school transcript.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">4. If dual credit or co-enrolled credit during high school, an official transcript from each college or university attended.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">5. A final high school transcript showing date of graduation.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">For questions regarding the Schreiner/Greystone Admissions process, please call Toll-free at (800)343-4919. Applicants who graduate from a non-accredited high school, a school that does not rank, a home-schooled program, or who earn a GED certificate instead of a high school diploma are required to discuss credentials with the Greystone&nbsp;Executive Director&nbsp;prior to package submission.</span></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;"><b>Application Deadlines</b></span></span></h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;"><b>Greystone at Schreiner University works on a <u>Rolling Admissions</u> basis that allows interested candidates to apply throughout the summer prior to joining the Greystone team for Summer Session in August.</b></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Candidates who apply to Greystone will participate in a series of Greystone GoToWebinars. &nbsp;These on-line&nbsp;presentations work in conjunction with our Summer Session which begins&nbsp;approximately 2 weeks before the first day of class and is&nbsp;designed to ensure that a significant portion of nomination and academy applications, as well as back-up plan applications are completed prior to the start of the Schreiner University academic year.&nbsp; Completion of this significant administrative burden empowers students to focus their time and energy on the task of improving their academic and athletic performance during the Schreiner academic year. &nbsp;As you continue to excel academically, athletically and as a leader, periodic updates will be submitted to your nomination sources and the academies to ensure that you receive credit for your best efforts. &nbsp;The academy admissions board place significant importance on improved academic performance when they consider post-high school candidates who seek reapplication, therefore, it makes sense to take advantage of this summer to get a head start on this next appointment cycle. &nbsp;Greystone is the only academy prep program offering this incredible opportunity to get ahead - this is yet another reason to join the Greystone team!</span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Admissions Policy</span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Schreiner University admits qualified students without regard to race, sex, color, religion, age, disability, veteran status or national origin. However, due to the physical and age requirements established for appointment to a United States service academy, Greystone applicants must meet or be capable of meeting the established academy admissions criteria to be accepted into the Greystone program.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Like Schreiner, Greystone admits students on a rolling admission basis. As soon as a file is complete, it is presented to the Schreiner Admissions Board for review. Once an admission decision is made and the student is admitted to Schreiner University, the student is presented to Greystone for evaluation by the Greystone Admissions Board. All students will be informed by Schreiner University and Greystone in writing of their status after all documents are evaluated. It is the responsibility of each applicant to ensure that <strong>all required documents are received in the Schreiner Office of Admission</strong> in a timely manner. All records and transcripts become the property of Schreiner University and will not be returned to the student or forwarded to another site.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">All students must have a health form and an immunization record on file in the Health Center. Health and accident insurance is mandatory for all Greystone students.</span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Admission Offer and Commitment Fee</span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">If a student accepts the Greystone offer of admission, the student is required to pay Schreiner University a $200 admission commitment fee, which serves as serious intent to enroll and is, therefore, non-refundable. The commitment fee reserves classroom space and reserves your room in the Greystone dorm. At the time of registration, the commitment fee is credited towards the student&#39;s account. Commitment fees are due to Schreiner University within 30 days of acceptance unless an extension is requested.</span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Physical Examination</span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Your Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DODMERB) physical examination is valid for 2 years.&nbsp; If your examination is older than 2 years, you will be required to undergo another DODMERB medical examination to ensure you are still within the physical fitness limits established for academy admission.&nbsp; If you require another DODMERB physical examination, it should be completed prior to arrival on campus to allow time for medical record screening by DODMERB and the possible need for waiver requests. Greystone is able to transport students to DODMERB medical facilities in the San Antonio area for the&nbsp;examination; however, the Greystone daily schedule during the academic year is extremely demanding, making medical appointments for non-emergencies difficult. Check with your academy recruiter to verify the status of your medical examination.</span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Special Admission Consideration</span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">All applicants are individually reviewed and evaluated by the Greystone Admissions Board before an admission decision is made. Students with insufficient academic preparation may be admitted with special conditions regarding course load and performance. Any applicant who is denied admission to the Greystone program has the right to appeal the denial by contacting the Greystone Director.</span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Tuition, Room, Board &amp; Fees</span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">The cost of public and private education has increased consistently over the last several years. This includes the costs for private academy preparatory schools as well as colleges and universities. Tuition costs at these specialized academy preparatory schools range from $9,000 to $49,000. As you conduct your research for the best institution, it is imperative that the program meets your individual needs as well as the academic expectations of the academies &ndash; not all programs are created equal, and cost is not always the best indicator of quality or relevance.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">The national average for a single year of private college education in 2017-2018 was $50,900*. However, the average cost for room, board, tuition, taxes and fees this year for a traditional student at Schreiner University carrying the same 38 credit hour course load is $37,699. The only direct costs payable to Schreiner for the 2018-19&nbsp;academic year include:</span><br />

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Greystone students are full-time college students co-enrolled at Schreiner University and therefore, if you have earned any college scholarships, they can be applied toward your tuition.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Greystone students pay the exact same amount ($39,278) for 38 credit hours as does a Schreiner student. &nbsp;What is not shown is that Schreiner University underwrites the total cost of the Greystone operational budget which equates to approximately $15,000 per student.&nbsp; When seen from the perspective of cost vs. value, for $30,045, Greystone students receive the value of a high quality college education along with the most successful academy preparatory program in the nation at no additional cost!&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">As an academy-bound student, you and your parents must look at each program as a major investment in your academic future. There is a great deal riding on this decision and it is not all about the cost of the prep school. The service academies estimate the value of their 4-year education and training experience to be worth approximately $500,000. This means that whatever the cost of your academic preparation, if you are successful in gaining admission to a service academy you will be receiving an education worth many times your investment that includes some of the most prestigious athletic and leadership training in the world. It also means you will have a job with career opportunities beyond your 5 years of initial service - something not all college graduates can say in this economy! Additionally, should you elect to get out of the service after the 5 year point, you can start your career search with an academy diploma in hand, experience as a junior officer and the reputation afforded to academy grads from the alumni network. All in all, it is worth the time and effort to choose wisely.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">When you evaluate a preparatory school, pay particular attention to whether the program can maximize the return on your investment. Determine if the program:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; provides a focused program tailored to meet your specific individual needs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; meets and exceeds the academy&#39;s recommended college-level coursework content for reapplying candidates.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; fully prepares each student for the physical, mental and emotional demands of the academies&#39; first-year - and beyond.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; assists students to develop the ethical and moral strengths that are critical requirements for academy success.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; provides each student with a valid, high-value back up plan should their year of prep not result in an academy appointment.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">The guiding principle for your selection of a preparatory school must be &ldquo;buyer beware&rdquo;. Make no mistake &ndash; you are a sought-after buyer, and there are sellers offering every level of quality, in a market where cost alone is not a reliable basis for a good decision.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;">Greystone has affiliated itself with Schreiner University to create a comprehensive program specifically designed for academy-bound students. Minimizing tuition cost and maximizing the academic, physical and ethical value of the program has been the top priority for Greystone. Comparatively speaking, Greystone offers excellent value for money: a true college-level curriculum, 38 earned college credits, academy-specific academics, physical preparation, character development, leadership training, personal growth and individual maturity. Do your homework, do the math, and you&#39;ll find that the value of the Greystone experience provides the highest potential for return of your preparatory school investment.</span></span></p>
