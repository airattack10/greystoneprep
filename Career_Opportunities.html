The advantages of the Greystone program are often not experienced immediately, but rather over time.&nbsp; In particular, the advantages of the university-level experience while not appreciated immediately by the student, does translate into performance that commands the attention of the academy admissions board during the appointment process.&nbsp; Additionally, the Schreiner academic experience further translates into enhanced academic performance once the Greystone student engages the challenges of the academy classroom.&nbsp; Sustained superior performance over their 4-year academy experience will elevate their class standing which can have a considerable impact on the scope and selection of career opportunities made available to the cadet or midshipman following graduation.&nbsp; The higher the academy academic GPA, the wider the selection of career opportunities and options presented to the future officer.&nbsp; For those seeking billets that are competitive (aviation, Special Forces, nuclear power, medical, etc.), it is in their best interests to excel academically throughout all four years &ndash; and getting a good start academically will set the tone for continued success in the classroom.</p>
