<h2>Support Mechanism</h2>

<hr />
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/134123_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: right;" />In the summer of 2022, twenty-three former Greystone students will graduate from the Naval Academy, Military Academy, Merchant Marine Academy, and Air Force Academy. That may not sound like much, but it is significant because those twenty-three former Greystoners represent a 97% graduation rate. For every Greystone student who enters the academies, 97% complete the academic and leadership program – graduate with a Bachelor's of Science Degree and a commission as an officer in the Armed Forces! That is significant because before they arrived at Greystone, they had all been turned down by the academies! But how did this miracle happen?</p>

Beginning on their first day at Greystone, they began creating the bonds that sustained them through the challenges they faced while at Greystone.  When they arrived at the academies, the team was still together – communicating with each other.  The bonds forged in the crucible of Greystone also served to unite them at the academies.  The pledge they made to each other while at Greystone was remade when they arrived at the academy.  They pledged to be there for each other regardless of circumstance – period.  And they were there – through the good times and the not so good times, they met socially, they met for study hall, they worked out together, they hung out together – because they were a team!</p>

The parents also served as communicators for each other and Greystone – keeping everyone informed of "things" as they happened. </p>

Along with graduations, there have been weddings and deployments, warfare qualifications, and professional accomplishments, thanks mainly to the team's support mechanism and the extended Greystone family. If there could be one thing responsible for our students' continued success as midshipmen, cadets, and officers, it is the unending support provided by the family.
