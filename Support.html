<h2>Support Mechanism</h2>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/134123_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 3px 5px; float: right;" /><span style="font-family:helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"In 2020, twenty-three former Greystone students will graduate from the Naval Academy, Military Academy, and Air Force Academy.  That may not sound like much, but it is significant because those twenty-three former Greystoners represent a 94% graduation rate.  For every Greystone student who enters the academies, 94% complete the academic and leadership program – graduate with a Bachelor’s of Science Degree and a commission as an officer in the Armed Forces!  That is significant!  But how did it happen?></span></span></p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/os_extranet_images/134125_original.jpg" style="border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; margin: 6px 5px; float: left;" />The team grew from a group of individuals into an extended family.&nbsp; Along with graduations, there have been weddings and deployments, warfare qualifications and professional accomplishments &ndash; thanks in large part to the support mechanism created by the team and the extended Greystone family. If there could be one thing responsible for the continued success of our students as midshipmen and cadets and officers it is the unending support provided by the family.&nbsp;</p>
